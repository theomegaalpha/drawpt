        <p class="text-md mb-2">
          This game started as a way to teach a friend how to code. The original idea turned out to
          beâ€¦ a bit ambitious. So we switched gears and worked on simpler projects together. But
          something about this one stuck with me. The concept had potential, and I didnâ€™t want to
          just drop it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-2">So I kept building.</p>
        <p class="text-md mb-2">
          Part of the journey was proving to myself that I could finish what I started. Itâ€™s easy to
          start something. Harder to see it through. This project became that challenge for me. A
          way to take something from zero to completion, to learn along the way, and to make
          something others might actually enjoy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-2">
          At its core, this game is about creativity, unpredictability, and shared laughter. Whether
          youâ€™re here to test your guessing skills, marvel at AI art, or just spend time with
          friends, Iâ€™m genuinely happy youâ€™re here.
