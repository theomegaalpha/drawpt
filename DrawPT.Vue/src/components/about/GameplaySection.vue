        <p class="text-md mb-8">
          Right now, the gameâ€™s all about the guessing. The AI gets a secret prompt and tries its
          best to draw it. You and everyone else in the lobby see the same drawing and try to figure
          out what the original prompt was.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-4 text-2xl font-bold">Whatâ€™s Coming Next</h2>
        <p class="text-md mb-2">
          Iâ€™m working on a new mode where you get to write the prompts. Each round, one player will
          come up with a creative, weird, or hilarious idea. The AI will try to draw it, and the
          rest of the lobby will guess what it is.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-2">
          Itâ€™s still in the works, but I wanted to share whatâ€™s coming because the project keeps
          growing (much more than I initially thought it would). I haven't figured out all the game
          mechanics yet, but I have some ideas that could make it even more fun.
