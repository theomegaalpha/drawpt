          Before AI, scoring in games like this was rigid. You were either right or wrong; no
          in-between.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-2 text-center">
          But with an AI acting as our in-game referee, things shift. Scoring becomes more fluid,
          more human in a way. You might not guess the exact prompt, but your answer could be close
          enough. You can be partially right.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md mb-2 text-center">
          This completely changes the game. I hope this gets your creative juices flowing.
